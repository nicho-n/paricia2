# paricia2
An open world, multiplayer space-trading simulator. <br>
Features are being rewritten from https://github.com/nicho-n/paricia0/tree/master/space (spaghetti code)

## Installation:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start 
```

## Testing:
```
$ npm test
```

## Usage:
In your browser, visit http://localhost:5000

## Notes:
Until an in-memory feature is added, you will need mongo running on your computer. <br>
Tests will not pass unless mongo and the game server is running.
